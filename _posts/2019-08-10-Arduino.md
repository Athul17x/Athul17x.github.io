<p>Arduino is an open-source hardware and software company, project and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices. For our task we used the Arduino Uno model. We unfortunatly couldn't work with an actual Arduino but the circuit simulator on Tinkercad does the job sufficiently. </p>

<p>We were assigned some reading material and tutorials on the working of the Arduino and also were given 5 tasks of increasing difficulty. The tasks ranged from lighting a bulb to controllong 4 DC motors. I wasn't really much interested in circuits and electronics in general because I've never been too good with it but after studying and doing these challenges using the Arduino IDE and Tinkercad, I really loved the blend of programming and circuitry.</p>

<p>I hope to get my hands on an actual Arduino in real life in the near future so that I can replicate these experiments in flesh.</p>
