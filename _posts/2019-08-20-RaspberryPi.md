<p>For those of you who aren't familiar with it, The Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers just about the size of a credit card that is developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote teaching of basic computer science in schools and colleges. I had never personally had the oppurtunity to work with a Raspberry Pi before but I was already excited to work with it after seeing it's aplications and uses on TV shows and videos.</p>

<p>Our first task was to download the Rasbian OS and then to flash it onto an SD card. We then had to insert the SD Card into the Raspberry Pi and connect it to a power source. Then we proceeded to hook up the Raspberry Pi to an external display monitor using a VGA to HDMI cable and also attached a keyboard and mouse. The Raspberry Pi then booted up to show a full blown destop with aplications like Python and Wolfram calculator. I was amazed to find out how this small little circuit to do so much</p>

<p>Our second task was to tranfer a file from our laptop to the Raspberry Pi using a local connection via an ethernet cable. Before that we had to find the IP adress of the Raspberry Pi using the "hostname -I" command and also enable the SSH protocol. Now using the "scp" command we had to tranfer a file. After trying to do it properly for almost half an hour, I realized I hadn't enabled wired connection on my laptop. And after wasting half an our becuase of my stupidity, I finally succeeded.</p> 

<p>Getting to know the basics of the Pi was really great experience and I hope that I'll get time to tinker around with it more in the future.</p>
