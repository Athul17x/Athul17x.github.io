<p>For those of you who aren't familiar with it, The Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers just about the size of a credit card that is developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote teaching of basic computer science in schools and colleges.</p>

<p>Our first task was to download the Rasbian OS and then to flash it onto an SD card</p>
