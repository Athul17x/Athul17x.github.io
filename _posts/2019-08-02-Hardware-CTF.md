<p>I first stumbled upon on the poster for the Hardware hacking challenge while making my way to class in the morning. It simply stated to go to the website "securehardware.in". Moving on to the challenge, it seemed easy enough at first. All I had too do was solve some logic gates to get a binary string which I had to then convert into Hexadecimal. This value had to be entered into the Tinkercad circuit embedded on the page and suddenly, for a brief second, the flag appeared on screen. Ar entering the value again, I carefully waited and got the entire flag this time.</p> 

<p>Now all that was left to submit the flag, but that wasn't as easy as it looked. There was an "Enter flag" button but it seemed to do nothing. After a few more tries, I turned my attention to the hint provided which told to look at the "source" of your inspiration. At that moment it hit me that I should probably check out the source code of the webpage using inspect element. And thanks to my luck, it was the right place to go as it contained the Google Forms link to submit the flag I received from the Tinkercad circuit earlier. Soon after submitting the form, I received a email congratuling me on completing the task.</p>

<p>And that was the story of my first encounter with flags.</p>
